                <h2>My Journey in Computer Science and Finance</h2>

                <p>
                    From the moment I started my degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds, 
                    I knew that technology would play a significant role in shaping the future. What I didn’t foresee was how deeply 
                    I would become immersed in the financial world alongside my technical pursuits. My journey in finance began 
                    unexpectedly, yet the combination of computer science and finance has become the driving force behind my career aspirations.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight">
                    “The combination of computer science and finance opened up new avenues for me, and I'm excited about where it will lead.”
                </div>

                <h3>A Leap into Finance</h3>
                <p>
                    During my summer internship at UTI Mutual Fund, I found myself stepping outside my comfort zone and diving into the world 
                    of equity research. Many wondered why someone studying computer science would take up an internship in finance. The answer was simple: 
                    I saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between data-driven technology and financial decision-making. This was my chance to combine 
                    my technical skills with a sector that thrives on data and analysis.
                </p>

                <div class="callout">
                    Developing Python-based tools at UTI was a pivotal moment—it showed how tech could revolutionize finance.
                </div>

                <h3>Bringing Technology to Finance</h3>
                <p>
                    My computer science background was not just an asset—it became a critical component of my work. I developed two Python-based tools during 
                    my internship, one for scraping hotel room prices from booking.com, and the other for capturing flight data from Google Flights. These tools 
                    streamlined data collection, ensuring that our financial models were built on the most current and accurate information available.

                <h3>Learning the Ropes of the Financial World</h3>
                <p>
                    The exposure to finance during my internship wasn’t limited to coding. I learned how to perform cash flow and financial ratio analysis, 
                    interpret annual reports, and analyze company and industry trends. These skills helped me develop a strong foundation in finance and 
                    understand how technology can enhance traditional methods of analysis used in the field.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight">
                    "With each new project, I found myself more deeply intrigued by how AI and machine learning could disrupt the financial landscape."
                </div>

                <h3>Expanding My Horizon</h3>
                <p>
                    The intersection of computer science and finance opened up new avenues for growth. As a student of artificial intelligence, 
                    I became fascinated by how AI could be applied in the financial sector, from predictive modeling to automating stock market analyses. 
                    My work with sentiment analysis and neural networks on various academic projects further fueled my passion for integrating AI with finance.
                </p>

                <h3>The Future</h3>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I aim to leverage my expertise in both computer science and finance to develop innovative solutions that can enhance 
                    decision-making in financial markets. Whether it's through creating sophisticated predictive algorithms or building systems that process 
                    financial data more efficiently, I am excited to be part of the technological transformation of the finance industry.

                <p>
                    My journey so far has been a blend of learning, exploration, and growth. With each project and internship, I’ve realized the limitless potential 
                    at the crossroads of these two disciplines. As I move forward, I’m more determined than ever to make an impact by bringing these worlds together 
                    in new and creative ways.
