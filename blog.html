            <h1>My Journey in Computer Science and Finance</h1>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <p>From the moment I started my degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds, I knew that technology would play a significant role in shaping the future. What I didn’t foresee was how deeply I would become immersed in the financial world alongside my technical pursuits. My journey in finance began unexpectedly, yet the combination of computer science and finance has become the driving force behind my career aspirations.</p>

                <h2>A Leap into Finance</h2>
                <p>During my summer internship at UTI Mutual Fund, I found myself stepping outside my comfort zone and diving into the world of equity research. Many wondered why someone studying computer science would take up an internship in finance. The answer was simple: I saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between data-driven technology and financial decision-making. This was my chance to combine my technical skills with a sector that thrives on data and analysis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Bringing Technology to Finance</h2>
                <p>My computer science background was not just an asset—it became a critical component of my work. I developed two Python-based tools during my internship, one for scraping hotel room prices from booking.com, and the other for capturing flight data from Google Flights. These tools streamlined data collection, ensuring that our financial models were built on the most current and accurate information available. It was exhilarating to see how a few lines of code could revolutionize the way financial data was processed and used for decision-making.</p>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Learning the Ropes of the Financial World</h2>
                <p>The exposure to finance during my internship wasn’t limited to coding. I learned how to perform cash flow and financial ratio analysis, interpret annual reports, and analyze company and industry trends. These skills helped me develop a strong foundation in finance and understand how technology can enhance the traditional methods of analysis used in the field.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, I aim to leverage my expertise in both computer science and finance to develop innovative solutions that can enhance decision-making in financial markets. Whether it's through creating sophisticated predictive algorithms or building systems that process financial data more efficiently, I am excited to be part of the technological transformation of the finance industry.</p>
