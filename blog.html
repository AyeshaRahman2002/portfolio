                <h2>My Beginnings in Technology</h2>
                <p>From the moment I started my degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence at the University of Leeds, I knew that technology would play a significant role in shaping the future. While I always had an interest in coding, my journey took an unexpected turn when I found myself diving into the world of finance alongside my technical studies.</p>
                <p>This dual focus on AI and finance opened up new horizons for me, allowing me to explore the intersection between data analysis and financial decision-making. The combination of my passion for technology and the challenges posed by financial markets has become the driving force behind my career aspirations.</p>

                <h2>A Leap into Finance</h2>
                <p>During my summer internship at UTI Mutual Fund, I found myself stepping outside my comfort zone and diving into the world of equity research. Many wondered why someone studying computer science would take up an internship in finance. The answer was simple: I saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between data-driven technology and financial decision-making.</p>
                <img src="images/uti-project-3.png" alt="UTI Internship" class="blog-image">
                <p>At UTI, I worked as part of the equity research team, analyzing financial data, conducting cash flow analysis, and developing insights into industries like hospitality. By dissecting annual reports and utilizing my programming knowledge, I was able to automate much of the data collection and analysis, which proved invaluable to the team.</p>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Bringing Technology to Finance</h2>
                <p>My computer science background was not just an asset—it became a critical component of my work. I developed two Python-based tools during my internship, one for scraping hotel room prices from booking.com, and the other for capturing flight data from Google Flights. These tools streamlined data collection, ensuring that our financial models were built on the most current and accurate information available.</p>
                <p>It was exhilarating to see how a few lines of code could revolutionize the way financial data was processed and used for decision-making. This experience taught me that technology, when applied effectively, can have a significant impact on financial modeling and predictions.</p>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>Learning the Ropes of the Financial World</h2>
                <p>Aside from my technical contributions, the internship gave me a solid understanding of how the financial industry operates. I learned how to perform cash flow and financial ratio analysis, interpret annual reports, and analyze company and industry trends. These skills helped me develop a strong foundation in finance, which complemented my technical knowledge.</p>
                <p>This exposure to real-world financial practices helped me understand how technology could enhance traditional methods of analysis. It also inspired me to explore further how artificial intelligence could be leveraged in financial decision-making.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blog-post">
                <h2>The Future</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, I aim to leverage my expertise in both computer science and finance to develop innovative solutions that can enhance decision-making in financial markets. Whether it's through creating sophisticated predictive algorithms or building systems that process financial data more efficiently, I am excited to be part of the technological transformation of the finance industry.</p>
                <img src="images/financial-world.jpg" alt="Future of Finance" class="blog-image">
                <p>My journey so far has been a blend of learning, exploration, and growth. With each project and internship, I’ve realized the limitless potential at the crossroads of these two disciplines. I am more determined than ever to make an impact by bringing these worlds together in new and creative ways.</p>
