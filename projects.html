The tool efficiently gathered data such as room types, prices, and availability, helping the equity research team analyze trends in the hotel industry and forecast revenue streams. By leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Pandas, the tool enhanced data collection speed by over 70%, streamlined the team's workflow, and provided critical insights that improved the accuracy of investment strategies.</p>

                    <p>This project, developed during my internship at UTI Mutual Fund, involved creating an automated flight data scraping tool using Python to collect flight information from Google Flights based on user-defined parameters such as travel dates, locations, and flight preferences. The tool used Playwright for browser automation and LexborHTMLParser for efficient HTML parsing, extracting data like flight prices, schedules, and layover details. By automating the data collection process, the tool streamlined analysts’ workflows, reducing manual efforts by over 60% and integrating real-time flight data into predictive models for investment strategies in the travel and tourism sectors.</p>

                    <p>This project focused on developing and evaluating decision tree models to predict outcomes based on provided datasets. Key aspects of the project included implementing a function to learn decision trees, testing the trees on training and test splits, and generating synthetic datasets to assess model performance as dataset size increased. An essential part of the project involved implementing pruning algorithms to prevent overfitting by removing nodes that did not significantly improve the model. The project also emphasized statistical evaluations, using metrics like error ratios and p-values to refine the decision tree's accuracy, providing a hands-on experience in machine learning with a focus on optimizing decision-making models.</p>

                    <h2>xv6 Memory Management</h2>
                    <p>In this project for COMP2211: Operating Systems, I implemented memory management functions in the xv6-riscv operating system, focusing on creating dynamic memory allocation with the malloc() and free() functions. The project involved using circular linked lists to efficiently manage memory allocation, minimizing fragmentation and waste. I also implemented the rqstMem() function to request additional memory when necessary, using system calls to expand the memory dynamically. This project enhanced my understanding of memory management in low-level systems programming and gave me practical experience in handling dynamic memory allocation in an operating system.</p>
