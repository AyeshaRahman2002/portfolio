AI-driven tools are transforming psychological treatments by offering immersive experiences for exposure therapy and providing accessible, cost-effective solutions for disorders like anxiety and depression. However, while AI enhances treatment options, ethical concerns arise due to the lack of emotional intelligence and the potential detachment from human therapists. The project concludes that AI holds great potential in expanding and improving mental health care, complementing traditional therapeutic methods.</p>

The tasks emphasized translating English sentences into formal logical formulae, verifying logical consistency, and deriving inferences.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Commuter:</strong> This problem explored travel modes, weather conditions, and their relationships. It required creating propositional logic rules such as "Rain implies no skateboarding" and "Being outside in the rain without a helmet leads to wet hair." The goal was to validate whether one would be splashed by cars unless traveling by taxi.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sunny Farm:</strong> This scenario focused on animals at a farm, requiring FOL representations like "No carnivores live at Sunny Farm" and "Every gentle animal helps every other gentle animal." The objective was to confirm the presence of a contented lamb through logical deductions.</p>
                        <p>Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in formal reasoning, automated theorem proving, and logic-based problem-solving, which are foundational for AI and advanced computational tasks.</p>

                        <p>This project comprised two major tasks: solving a logical reasoning problem using Prover9 and developing a knowledge base with an inference engine in Prolog.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q1: River Crossing Puzzle Using Prover9:</strong> The task involved solving a classic river crossing problem where a farmer needs to transport a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river without leaving incompatible items together. The solution required encoding the problem in propositional logic and verifying its validity using the Prover9 theorem prover. Logical constraints ensured rules like "The goat cannot stay with the cabbage without the farmer" were satisfied, leading to the correct sequence of crossings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q2: Knowledge Base and Inference System Using Prolog:</strong> This involved developing a Prolog knowledge base for wildlife management, covering domains such as animals, habitats, people, and governance. The KB included 68 facts and 71 rules, enabling automated inferences about predator-prey relationships, habitat safety, and resource allocation. Interesting inferences included preparing a special enclosure for the most aggressive predator and escalating emergencies to government authorities, showcasing the KB's ability to model real-world scenarios.</p>
                        <p>Through these tasks, I developed expertise in formal reasoning, automated theorem proving, and knowledge representation, which are essential for AI applications in logic-based problem-solving and intelligent systems development.</p>
