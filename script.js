            <h2>Creating a Classification Model Using Online Sentiment to Determine Stock Price</h2>
            <p>The group project aimed to develop a robust sentiment analysis-based classification model to predict stock price movements. The project explored the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and financial market analysis, focusing on the ability of sentiment data to forecast stock price trends. This project utilized large-scale, unstructured data from social platforms such as Amazon and Twitter, emphasizing the influence of customer reviews and public opinion on market performance.</p>
            <p>The technical challenge in this project involved handling and processing vast amounts of raw sentiment data, which is inherently unstructured. The team tackled this issue using advanced techniques such as tokenization, sentiment polarity extraction, and NLP-based feature engineering to clean and structure the data for further analysis. This process ensured that the sentiment data was in a usable form, ready for machine learning applications.</p>
            <p>Once the data was preprocessed, the sentiment analysis model was trained using various machine learning algorithms, particularly focusing on classification accuracy and model performance. The team experimented with different classification techniques, including logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and support vector machines (SVM) to determine the best approach for predicting stock price changes. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy, ensuring the reliability of the predictions.</p>
            <p>A key innovation in this project was the integration of sentiment data with traditional financial forecasting models. By combining sentiment analysis with historical stock price data, the team was able to enhance the model's predictive power. The project demonstrated that sentiment, especially as captured from large public platforms, could serve as a valuable leading indicator for stock price movements. For instance, a surge in positive reviews or discussions about a product on Amazon or Twitter might correspond with an increase in the company's stock price, while negative sentiment could indicate a forthcoming drop.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the project addressed the challenge of overfitting in machine learning models, particularly when working with large datasets. The team employed techniques such as cross-validation and regularization to improve the modelâ€™s generalization ability and to ensure that it would perform well on unseen data.</p>
            <p>This project is a testament to the power of data-driven decision-making in finance, showcasing how modern AI techniques like sentiment analysis can be applied to predict market trends. The project not only highlighted technical expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and NLP but also underscored the practical relevance of using sentiment as a predictive tool in financial markets. With the rise of social media and online reviews influencing public perception, the ability to harness this data provides a competitive edge in investment strategies. The success of this project positions it as a significant contribution to the field of AI in finance, offering a novel approach to stock market prediction through the lens of sentiment analysis.</p>

            <h2>xv6 Memory Management</h2>
            <p>In this project for COMP2211: Operating Systems, I implemented memory management functions for the xv6-riscv operating system, specifically focusing on the malloc() and free() operations. The xv6 operating system, designed as a teaching tool, provided a robust platform to understand how memory allocation works within an operating system's kernel.</p>
            <p>The malloc() function I implemented dynamically allocates memory using the concept of circular linked lists. The function checks if the requested size is valid and assigns memory using a circular linked list structure, where the last node links back to the first node. This structure allowed efficient memory allocation and management, particularly useful in minimizing wasted space and optimizing memory use.</p>
            <p>I also created the free() function, which deallocates memory blocks previously assigned by malloc(). This function checks for null pointers and properly handles memory release by merging adjacent free blocks, thus preventing fragmentation.</p>
            <p>A key feature of my implementation was the rqstMem() function, which requests additional memory from the operating system when required. The function employs the system call sbrk(), adjusting the program's data space and dynamically increasing the memory when needed. This efficient management ensures that memory is only expanded when absolutely necessary, minimizing system overhead.</p>
            <p>Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of how memory management works in low-level systems programming. I gained valuable experience in debugging complex C programs, learned to manage dynamic memory efficiently, and enhanced my understanding of how operating systems handle memory allocation and deallocation at the kernel level. This project not only strengthened my skills in C programming but also gave me hands-on exposure to core operating system concepts.</p>

            <p>This project explored the development and implementation of an AI-based digital health prototype for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. The project aimed to fill the gap in diagnostic tools that typically focus on children, using machine learning to analyze eye movements, textual input, and social interactions. The application features several modules, including eye-tracking analysis, a machine-learning-based note-tracking system, and a natural language processing (NLP) game that simulates social scenarios.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses AI techniques like eye-movement tracking and sentiment analysis to assist in ASD diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Focuses on gender differences in diagnosis, especially addressing the challenges women face in being diagnosed with ASD.</li>
                <li>Designed with ethical considerations, such as reducing bias in the AI model and ensuring data privacy.</li>

            <p>This project aimed to develop a robust autonomous navigation system for spacecraft, specifically addressing the challenge of determining a spacecraft's precise location after being knocked off course by an explosion. The system employs various AI techniques, laser scanning, and machine learning to ensure successful navigation and location detection.</p>
            <p>Key components of the system include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Navigation Initialization:</strong> The robotic unit starts by receiving predefined target coordinates (entrances and centers of spacecraft modules) to autonomously move between points. ROS 2's action framework allows the system to handle real-time movement adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Red and Green Sign Detection:</strong> The robot uses image processing techniques to detect red and green signs at entrances. A green sign allows entry to a module, while a red sign prompts the robot to avoid the room. The sign detection is achieved using HSV masks and contour detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Wall Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance:</strong> The robot uses LaserScan data to detect walls and obstacles. PID controllers ensure the robot maintains a consistent distance from walls while navigating safely. This feature was thoroughly tested in various simulated environments to confirm its reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Window Detection and Heuristic Prediction:</strong> Heuristic methods are employed to predict the possible locations of windows within a room. The robot checks for rectangular shapes with specific characteristics (e.g., a white border and a predominantly black interior) to identify windows. Once a window is detected, the robot aligns itself to the window and captures screenshots for further analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Screenshot and Image Stitching:</strong> The robot takes multiple screenshots of the detected windows and stitches them together into a panorama. This panorama is then analyzed to detect celestial bodies such as Earth, Moon, Mars, and Mercury.</li>
                <li><strong>Planet Detection and Distance Measurement:</strong> Using machine learning models (ResNet18), the system detects planets within the panorama and measures their distances based on the size and positions of the planets in the images. A custom heuristic method ensures accurate distance calculations between detected planets.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing and Validation:</strong> The system was tested in both simulated and real-world environments. Simple navigation and heuristic grid navigation were tested, revealing the system's robustness in dynamic environments. However, issues with LaserScan data in real-world scenarios led to the proposal of "LaserScan Stretching" to improve data consistency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This comprehensive system offers precise spacecraft navigation, robust obstacle avoidance, and accurate planetary detection and measurement capabilities, making it suitable for autonomous missions in challenging space environments.</p>

            <h2>Interactive 3D Rendering Application</h2>
            <p>The project begins with implementing essential matrix and vector functions, such as matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication, which are critical for transformations in 3D space. These functions were tested rigorously using the Catch2 testing framework to verify the correctness of mathematical operations, ensuring accurate rendering in later stages.</p>
            <p>The 3D rendering pipeline was initiated by loading a Wavefront OBJ file representing the terrain mesh. This involved setting up OpenGL using GLFW for window management and GLAD for function loading. Shaders were employed to handle vertex transformations and fragment coloring, with a simple vertex shader to transform model coordinates into screen space and a fragment shader for basic shading. The camera system allowed users to navigate the scene using keyboard inputs (WSAD keys for movement) and mouse input for view control, simulating a first-person perspective.</p>
            <p>Following the basic rendering setup, texture mapping was applied to the terrain. Orthophotos were used as textures, which required configuring vertex buffer objects (VBOs) and vertex array objects (VAOs) to include texture coordinates. The fragment shader was modified to sample textures correctly and map them onto the terrain surface. Initial challenges included incorrect texture application, which was resolved through adjustments to the texture sampling and proper handling of texture coordinates.</p>
            <p>Instancing was introduced to efficiently render multiple objects, specifically two launch pads placed at predefined locations on the terrain. Instancing reduced the overhead of rendering duplicate objects and allowed the placement of these pads with minimal performance impact. Textures were also applied to these objects to enhance visual realism.</p>
            <p>A custom 3D rocket model was constructed using basic primitives (cubes, cylinders, and cones) combined with translation, rotation, and scaling transformations. The model was assembled by merging individual components into a cohesive object, then positioned atop one of the launch pads. This custom model demonstrated advanced OpenGL transformations and object creation techniques.</p>
            <p>Lighting was incorporated using the Blinn-Phong shading model, which simulates ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections from light sources. This was further enhanced by adding point lights with distance attenuation, ensuring realistic light behavior as the camera moved through the scene. Debugging was necessary to resolve issues with light sources following the camera, which led to adjustments in light positioning and behavior.</p>
            <p>The rocket model was then animated to simulate a launch sequence. Using a state machine, the animation progressed through phases, including vertical lift-off, transition to horizontal flight, and continuous movement. This was implemented using time-based animation functions, ensuring smooth transitions between different phases of the rocketâ€™s motion.</p>
            <p>Performance measurements were taken to evaluate the GPUâ€™s handling of various tasks, including terrain rendering, instancing, and custom model rendering. The analysis showed a significant increase in rendering time for more complex tasks, particularly when adding textures and custom models. The performance data also indicated that camera positioning had a noticeable impact on frame rates, with rendering times increasing as the camera moved further from the main objects of interest.</p>
            <p>Overall, the coursework successfully demonstrated advanced 3D rendering techniques in OpenGL, integrating various components such as matrix transformations, lighting, animation, and performance optimization. The projectâ€™s culmination in a dynamic, interactive 3D scene reflects a deep understanding of modern graphics programming and the complexities of real-time rendering systems.</p>

            <h2>Use of AI in Psychological Treatments</h2>
            <p>This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied to psychological treatments, providing both opportunities and challenges. The paper focuses on key AI-based methodologies, particularly Virtual Reality Therapy and Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT), as modern tools aiding psychological treatment.</p>
            <p>AI's integration in clinical psychology is already visible in several forms, such as self-help websites, AI-powered chatbots for mental health support, and Virtual Reality (VR)-based therapy for exposure treatments. Virtual Reality Therapy creates immersive, realistic experiences that allow patients to confront fears in controlled environments, making it especially useful for treating anxiety disorders, phobias, and PTSD. For example, a patient with a fear of heights can experience simulations of such scenarios to gradually reduce their fear through exposure. This method effectively bridges the gap between traditional therapy and the technological world.</p>
            <p>Another key innovation, Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT), provides accessible, affordable, and high-fidelity treatment for patients with conditions like depression. This method eliminates geographical barriers and can reach a larger audience, offering personalized therapeutic experiences through AI algorithms.</p>
            <p>However, the application of AI in psychological treatments raises certain ethical and practical concerns. AI systems lack emotional intelligence and the therapeutic connection between a patient and therapist. Additionally, some AI applications risk prescribing incorrect treatment if not supervised, posing risks in situations that require human intuition and flexibility. The connection between patients and therapists, which is essential for trust and therapeutic success, may be diminished as patients rely on technology.</p>
            <p>Despite these risks, the paper concludes that AI will continue to play a pivotal role in enhancing psychological treatments. The evolving nature of AI technologies like virtual reality and AI-driven behavioral analysis will offer more opportunities for psychologists to treat patients more effectively. As AI continues to improve, it holds the potential to complement traditional therapeutic methods and make mental health care more accessible to wider populations.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Features of Aarogya Setu and COVIDSafe:</strong> Aarogya Setu combines Bluetooth and GPS tracking to detect the proximity of users to each other and logs interactions between users. It provides real-time information regarding the COVID-19 status in the vicinity, tracks health status, and offers updates on vaccination slots, symptom checkers, and risk assessments. The app also acted as a self-assessment tool and became compulsory for millions of Indians, as it was required for travel, access to public places, and certain work environments.</p>
    
            <p>COVIDSafe relies solely on Bluetooth proximity data to track close contacts. The app logs encrypted data about user interactions and requires manual verification if a user tests positive. COVIDSafe was voluntary and aimed to protect user privacy by not using location tracking (no GPS). It provided notifications to users if they had come in contact with an infected person within the past 21 days. However, the app faced challenges in gaining widespread adoption, resulting in limitations in its effectiveness.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Technical Comparison:</strong> The project examines the technical implementation of both apps, noting the trade-offs between privacy and functionality. Aarogya Setuâ€™s GPS tracking allowed for more detailed data on user movement and regional hotspots, giving users and government authorities a more comprehensive view of the pandemicâ€™s spread. However, this raised serious privacy concerns due to the appâ€™s broad access to personal data, particularly as it was mandatory in many circumstances.</p>
    
            <p>COVIDSafe, on the other hand, opted for a privacy-first approach by excluding location data and solely using Bluetooth for proximity detection. While this was a positive step in ensuring user privacy, the lack of GPS data limited its ability to provide real-time localized data, and the app's voluntary nature meant it struggled to reach a critical mass of users required for effective contact tracing.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Aarogya Setuâ€™s mandatory nature, combined with the use of GPS tracking, stirred debates about data privacy, security, and potential misuse of personal information. While the app provided detailed infection mapping and robust tracking, it was criticized for not being open-source during the initial phases, limiting transparency.</p>
    
            <p>COVIDSafe, by design, was more focused on user privacy, encrypting data, and using decentralized storage. It adopted a voluntary opt-in model that respected individual choice, but this approach, combined with a lower adoption rate, significantly reduced its efficacy in tracking COVID-19 infections and controlling the pandemic spread.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Adoption and Efficacy:</strong> Aarogya Setu had a significantly higher adoption rate, partly because of its mandatory usage policy in public spaces, workplaces, and for travel in India. However, this raised ethical concerns about forcing a population to use technology that collected sensitive personal information.</p>
    
            <p>Conversely, COVIDSafe faced several challenges in achieving widespread adoption due to its voluntary nature. Australiaâ€™s decentralized health system, combined with privacy-first policies, meant that many citizens were reluctant to install the app. Technical issues, like Bluetooth connectivity failures and battery drainage, also contributed to the app's limited success. Moreover, its dependency on manual input from health officials and users slowed down its ability to quickly identify and isolate cases.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Limitations and Future Outlook:</strong> Both apps had significant limitations in ensuring optimal performance. Aarogya Setuâ€™s GPS reliance made it more resource-heavy and prone to privacy breaches, which could dissuade user trust. Meanwhile, COVIDSafeâ€™s reliance on voluntary adoption and Bluetooth-only tracking rendered it less effective in identifying close contacts in a timely manner, especially in cases where individuals failed to manually report symptoms or test results.</p>
    
            <p>The project concludes by highlighting potential improvements that could be made to both applications. It suggests that future iterations of such apps should focus on balancing privacy with functionality, possibly by adopting a decentralized model that gives users more control over their data, while still allowing health authorities to monitor outbreaks effectively.</p>
    
            <p>In the end, the project demonstrates how Aarogya Setu and COVIDSafe represented two distinct approaches to public health technologyâ€”one prioritizing comprehensive data collection and compulsory usage, and the other emphasizing privacy and voluntary participation. Both approaches had their merits and challenges, but neither emerged as a definitive solution to pandemic management through digital contact tracing.</p>

            â”œâ”€â”€ car_factory.py        # Factory for creating car models
            â”œâ”€â”€ car.py                # Car class that integrates engine, battery, and tires
            â”œâ”€â”€ engine/               # Different engine classes (Capulet, Sternman, Willoughby)
            â”œâ”€â”€ battery/              # Battery classes (Spindler, Nubbin)
            â”œâ”€â”€ tires/                # Tire classes (Carrigan, Octoprime)
            â”œâ”€â”€ test/                 # Unit tests for engines, batteries, and tires
            â””â”€â”€ serviceable.py        # Serviceable interface for components
            </pre>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>The <strong>CarFactory</strong> class is the entry point for creating cars. Depending on the model, it assembles a car with different combinations of engines, batteries, and tires. The car's <code>needs_service()</code> method checks whether any component requires servicing based on its specific conditions.</p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Each component (engine, battery, tire) can be independently swapped or modified, making the system highly extensible.</li>
                <li><strong>Factory Design Pattern:</strong> Simplifies the creation of different car models and ensures that components are correctly assembled.</li>
                <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> The project includes comprehensive unit tests that cover every component, ensuring that the system behaves as expected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>The project includes extensive unit testing to verify that each component of the car works correctly. These tests ensure that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Engines, batteries, and tires are correctly serviced based on their respective conditions.</li>
                <li>The car's overall service status is accurate, based on the service status of its individual components.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The Lyft System Design project is a comprehensive, modular, and well-structured simulation of a car manufacturing and servicing system. Each stage builds on the previous one, adding new components and expanding the systemâ€™s capabilities.

            <h2>Olympic Medal Analysis Using Data Visualizations</h2>
            <p>The Olympic Medal Analysis project focuses on examining historical Olympic medal data from 1896 to 2020. The projectâ€™s primary objective was to analyze medal distributions across countries and over time using a combination of visual techniques and data analysis methodologies. The goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of different visualization techniques in communicating complex historical data and trends.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Project Objectives:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>To analyze Olympic medal counts from 1896 to 2020, highlighting trends and patterns across countries.</li>

            <h2>2D Rendering Application - Computer Graphics</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on the development of a 2D rendering application that highlights key concepts in computer graphics, specifically in the area of geometric shape rendering and transformations. The main objectives of the project were to render 2D objects using line-drawing algorithms, implement transformations (such as scaling, rotation, and translation), and fill shapes with color using advanced rasterization techniques.</p>
    
            <h3>Line Drawing Algorithms</h3>
            <p>The project implements fundamental line-drawing algorithms such as Bresenham's Line Algorithm and the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm. These algorithms ensure efficient and accurate rendering of lines on a pixel grid. Bresenham's algorithm, in particular, was chosen for its speed and precision, minimizing the use of floating-point operations. This ensures that lines drawn on the screen appear smooth and continuous, even for large or steep line segments. The DDA algorithm was also used to compare the performance and visual outcomes of different approaches to line rendering.</p>
    
            <h3>Geometric Transformations</h3>
            <p>To manipulate 2D objects dynamically, the project implemented basic geometric transformations, including translation, scaling, and rotation. These operations were applied using matrix multiplication techniques. The transformations allow users to interact with the shapes by changing their position, size, and orientation in the 2D space. The project explored both uniform and non-uniform scaling, ensuring that objects maintain their aspect ratio when desired or stretch dynamically based on input.</p>
    
            <h3>Shape Filling and Rasterization</h3>
            <p>In addition to drawing shapes, the application employs scanline algorithms for filling polygons and other geometric forms. The scanline algorithm was used to fill shapes with solid or interpolated colors, depending on the desired effect. By interpolating color values across the surface of the shape, the application can produce visually appealing gradients, giving depth to the 2D objects. The project carefully handles edge cases, such as concave polygons and self-intersecting shapes, ensuring that the rasterization is robust and accurate.</p>
    
            <h3>Polygon Clipping and Windowing</h3>
            <p>The project also includes polygon clipping, where objects that extend beyond a defined viewing window are truncated to fit within the visible area. The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm was used to efficiently clip polygons against a rectangular clipping boundary. This feature is particularly useful for creating complex scenes where not all objects are fully visible within the viewport.</p>
    
            <h3>User Interaction and Controls</h3>
            <p>The application provides an interactive interface, allowing users to manipulate the 2D shapes in real-time. Users can input translation vectors, scaling factors, and rotation angles to see the immediate effect of these transformations on the rendered objects. Additionally, the application supports mouse-based selection and transformation, enhancing the usability and interactivity of the tool.</p>
    
            <h3>Anti-Aliasing and Smoothing</h3>
            <p>To improve the visual quality of the rendered shapes, the project incorporates basic anti-aliasing techniques. By smoothing jagged edges on diagonal or curved lines, the application produces more aesthetically pleasing images. The anti-aliasing algorithm works by blending the colors of edge pixels with their neighbors, reducing the stark contrast that typically causes aliasing artifacts.</p>
    
            <h3>Performance and Optimization</h3>
            <p>Performance was a key consideration throughout the development process. The project optimized the line-drawing and filling algorithms to minimize computational overhead, ensuring that even complex scenes with multiple objects and transformations could be rendered in real-time. Additionally, the application efficiently manages memory usage by dynamically allocating space for pixel buffers only when necessary, reducing the overall resource footprint.</p>
    
            <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
            <p>Extensive testing was conducted to validate the accuracy of the rendering algorithms. The application was tested on a variety of shapes and transformations, including regular polygons, concave shapes, and complex overlapping objects. Special attention was given to ensuring that transformations such as rotation preserved the integrity of the shapes, even when applied repeatedly.</p>
    
            <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
            <p>While the project successfully implements the core features of 2D rendering, there are several areas for future improvement. Potential enhancements include adding support for advanced shading techniques, integrating additional anti-aliasing algorithms, and expanding the transformation capabilities to include shear and reflection operations. Additionally, the application could be extended to support more complex user interactions, such as dragging and resizing objects directly on the canvas.</p>
    
            <p>This project demonstrates a solid understanding of fundamental computer graphics concepts, from line drawing and shape rendering to geometric transformations and rasterization. The efficient implementation of these techniques allows the application to handle real-time rendering of complex 2D scenes with minimal computational overhead.</p>

            <p>This project, undertaken as part of my COMP3611 coursework, involved applying machine learning techniques to predict outcomes from provided training data. The core objective was to build a predictive model that could accurately classify data from a structured dataset while handling both clean and corrupted data formats.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> The project began with data cleaning and preprocessing steps. I handled the corrupted data file <code>corrupted_data.npy</code>, which involved identifying and managing missing or inconsistent data. Using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, I cleaned the dataset to prepare it for effective model training.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Feature Extraction and Engineering:</strong> Once the data was cleaned, feature engineering techniques were applied to extract important variables from the dataset. These features helped to improve model accuracy by selecting the most relevant information for predictions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Model Training:</strong> Various machine learning algorithms were employed for classification, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and random forests. The models were trained using the cleaned dataset from <code>Training_data.csv</code>, with corresponding target values from <code>Training_data_targets.csv</code>. Each model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to identify the most effective algorithm for the given task.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Handling Corrupted Data:</strong> A unique aspect of this project was dealing with corrupted data files. I developed strategies to reconstruct lost data points from the <code>corrupted_data.npy</code> file and re-trained the model with this modified data to test how well it could generalize despite missing information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Model Evaluation and Tuning:</strong> After initial model training, hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize performance. Cross-validation techniques were employed to ensure that the model would generalize well on unseen data. The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy score on the clean dataset, showcasing robust predictive capabilities.</p>
            
            <p>This coursework demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. It involved hands-on experience in data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The final model was able to provide valuable predictions despite the challenges presented by the corrupted data.</p>
