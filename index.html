        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a 3rd-year MEng (Hons) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Leeds, graduating in 2024. My academic journey has given me strong technical skills in software engineering, AI, and machine learning, which I aim to apply in solving real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked on a variety of technical projects, including an AI-based healthcare tool for Autism detection and a stock market sentiment analysis tool. I am passionate about blending creativity with technology and have built an engaging presence in the art world through my Instagram (@artxar_).
        </p>
        <p>
            With proficiency in C++, Python, Java, and more, I strive to leverage my skills to drive innovation in AI, robotics, and beyond.

                <h3>AI-Based Stock Market Sentiment Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    A neural network-based tool that analyzes sentiment data from social media to predict stock market fluctuations. This project provides valuable insights for investors, helping them track trends and make informed decisions. I developed the sentiment analysis model and designed the neural network architecture using Python and WEKA.

            <h3>Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection AI Application</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a healthcare application that utilizes machine learning and eye-tracking data to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. The tool analyzes social interactions, facial expressions, and eye movement patterns using natural language processing (NLP). It provides user feedback based on questionnaires and interactive tasks, trained on synthetic data to improve accuracy.

            <h3>Web Scraping Tools for Hotel and Flight Pricing</h3>
            <p>
                Built Python-based web scraping tools for a mutual fund company to monitor hotel and flight pricing. The data collected was used to generate insights for equity research and presentations to fund managers. My tool automated price comparison and data collection for investment analysis.
