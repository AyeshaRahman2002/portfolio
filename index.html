        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #fff; display: inline-block; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem;"></span>
        <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.6; padding: 1rem 2rem; font-size: 1.1rem;">
            Born and raised in India, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia, I embarked on my academic journey by pursuing a Master of Engineering in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (2024-25). My fascination with technology began at a young age, but it was during my undergraduate years (2021-24) that I discovered my passion for applying AI to solve real-world problems. At the University of Leeds, I gained hands-on experience working on innovative projects ranging from high-frequency trading systems to sentiment analysis for stock market predictions. Each project not only sharpened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, precision, and problem-solving in dynamic environments.
            <br><br>
            My interest in finance led me to explore the convergence of AI and the financial markets. I realized that the future of finance lies in leveraging data-driven insights, and I became determined to specialize in AI for market predictions. This led to my participation in multiple research-driven projects, where I combined sentiment analysis with neural networks to create predictive models that could potentially impact investment strategies. I have also gained onsight experience working for investment firms allowing me to combine my knowledge and skills in both Artificial Intelligence and Finance field. 
            <br><br>
            Apart from academia, I’ve also earned several certifications in blockchain, finance, and software development, which have further strengthened my understanding of cutting-edge technologies. My thirst for knowledge drives me to stay updated with the latest developments in AI, finance, and design, as I constantly look for new challenges that push my boundaries.
            <br><br>
            In the coming years, I aim to bring my skills and knowledge to innovative companies where I can continue merging my expertise in AI with the ever-evolving financial landscape. Whether it's through predictive algorithms, building efficient systems, or optimizing processes, I look forward to contributing to shaping the future of technology and finance.
