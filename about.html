        <p>
            I am a full-time student pursuing an MEng (Hons) in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at The University of Leeds, expected to graduate in 2024. 
            My passion for exploring various forms of art has fostered a creative thought process, while my dedication to Computer Science and AI has instilled effective time management skills.

        <p>
            I have experience in software engineering and have worked on diverse projects, including a healthcare application focused on detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using AI. 
            My journey reflects a strong commitment to leveraging technology for social good.
